# BradenBot2.0

Hello! Hopefully this should walk you through step by step on how to run the Braden Bot on Mac, if you're on Windows hopwfully I fix that soon 

1) First obviously if you are here you have found the GitHub repo but just in case you haven't the link for this can be found here 
https://github.com/bkirkend/IRbot

2) The next thing you want to do is download ngrock which you can find at this link here 
https://download.ngrok.com/downloads/mac-os?tab=download
Assuming you download it as a file it will appear in your Dowloads folder as a zip file, leave it there don't touch it 
Open up your terminal and paste this bad boy in sudo unzip ~/Downloads/ngrok-v3-stable-darwin-arm64.zip -d /usr/local/bin

3) You're going to want to make an account that will give you a custom token for ngrock, honestly the best way to do this is through linking 
your Github account and it will generate something like this - this is my token this will not work for you you need to get your own but when you 
your token just replace yours with mine and paste it in the terminal. 

ngrok config add-authtoken 2sTCgzkgS4lXBRZyz3hxuckWhcd_4TsD5pbDj6W5WGxoPSMyk

4) You are going to need to have flask to run this code to download this you do 
python3 -m pip install flask


4) Now we start running ngrock with this lovely command right here 

ngrok http http://localhost:8080

Just for some context this is what connects

3) Create a GroupMe Developers Account https://dev.groupme.com/


insstall requests 

I have to turn off airplay reciever to get server.py to get it to run you might also have to dowload other libraries it will tell you when you 
try to run it
